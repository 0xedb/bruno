    My interest in computers was piqued at young age. I first learned about
    programming at age 12, reading about the BASIC programming language from the
    appendix of a math book. Around that time, I read extensively about
    computers. Over a decade down the line, Iâ€™m happy my little self made a
    great decision to take a career path that gives me endless possibilities.
