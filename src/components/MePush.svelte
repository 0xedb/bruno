      My interest in computers was piqued at young age. I first learned about
      programming at age 12, reading about the BASIC programming language from
      the appendix of a math book. My boarding school prohibited reading
      unapproved books, so I came very early to school when no one was around
      and read as much as I could. I couldn’t use a computer for practice so I
      wrote code on paper and compiled it myself. I’d solve the programming
      questions and compare with the answers from the book. Additionally, I’d
      give myself feedback on on every question. Around that time, I read
      extensively about computers. Over a decade down the line, I’m happy my
      little self made a great decision to take a career path that gives me
      endless possibilities.
