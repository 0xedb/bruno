      My interest in computers was piqued at young age. I first learned about
      programming at age 12, reading about the BASIC programming language from
      the appendix of a math book. Around that time, I read
      extensively about computers. Over a decade down the line, Iâ€™m happy my
      little self made a great decision to take a career path that gives me
      endless possibilities.
